# ng-page-title

Page title directive for an Angular project

# Why

The `<title>` tag is something that needs to be done on pretty much every project, but can be a right pain in the arse
in AngularJS if you aren't sure what you're doing.  This makes it the work of but-a-moment to put in a dynamic page
title. It also interpolates resolved data automatically.

This currently works only for [UI Router](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/site/#/api/ui.router) states

# Future

Add support for [angular-router](https://github.com/angular/router)
